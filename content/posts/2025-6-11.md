The internet is nothing if not democratic. The printing press gave the written word to the masses and the internet is merely another development in democratization.

But why yet another website/blog/opinion when there are already so many? "Because I'm a human being simply existing." None of us asked to be born yet here we are. It's like asking Why do anything at all?

This is a place to sift through the rubble of modern life and plant flowers in the wreckage.
