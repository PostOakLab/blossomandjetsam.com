Hello there!

In this first post I just wanted to introduce myself and explain why I decided to create this platform.

My name is Ryan and I am a curious person. I love to learn and I hope I never come to believe I have arrived and that I don't have more to learn.

This is a place to reflect on whatever is interesting out here in the debris of modern life and plant flowers in the wreckage.
